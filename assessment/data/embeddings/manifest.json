Here's how to navigate it:\n\n1. Start by finding your SAE Level. Use the self-assessment checklist to identify where your current AI usage falls — from L0 (fully manual) to L4 (mostly automated). Be honest. Most product designers in early 2026 are somewhere between L1 and L2.\n\n2. Then find your E-P-I-A-S maturity within that level. Are you just experimenting (Explorer)? Running consistent workflows (Practitioner)? Building systems others rely on (Architect)? Your maturity at your current level matters more than which level you're at.",

Going deeper at L1 before jumping to L3 is often the smarter path, because the judgment and habits you build carry forward.\n\nBONUS: If you're a design leader, use this to map your team. You'll likely find people spread across multiple SAE levels and maturity stages. That's normal and healthy. The framework helps you have concrete conversations about where people are and where they want to go — without it becoming a race to the highest SAE number.\n\nOne important thing to internalize: an S-Steward at SAE L1 (someone who's built organizational standards for ChatGPT usage) is more mature and more valuable than an E-Explorer at SAE L4 (someone fumbling with advanced toolchains).
